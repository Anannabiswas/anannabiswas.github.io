   <p>
    I spend my leisure time through many different ways: writing diaries, reading books (mostly non-fiction), raising indoor plants and solving 
    rubik's cube(classic 3X3). I love to draw and listen classical music. I also try to learn different types of musical instruments. At present, I am learning to play
    the flute. Above all, I enjoy myself when with my family members and close friends.
