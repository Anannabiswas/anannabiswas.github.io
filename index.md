 Hello, I am Ananna. a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Michigan Technological University. I am working in the
 <a href ="https://sites.google.com/mtu.edu/hongyu/home" target="_blank"> Brain-Inspired AI Lab</a> as a Research Assistant under the supervision of 
 <a href = "https://sites.google.com/mtu.edu/hongyu/group" target="_blank">Dr. Hongyu An </a>. My current project is on neuromorphic deep brain stimulation system. I received my B.Sc. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET), Khulna, Bangladesh in 2019. 

 As a part of my skill development, I participated in the <a href = "https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html" target="_blank">NMA Summer School of 
 Computational Neuroscience</a> course in 2022 and completed the project <a href = "https://anannabiswas.github.io/projects" target="_blank"> (Activity in Mouse Visual
 Cortex Predicts Spontaneous Running Behaviour)</a> successfully. Our abstract regarding the project work<a href =                                                          "https://www.reddit.com/r/neuromatch/comments/xo3w0x/ananna_biswas_exploring_the_mouse_visual_cortex/" target="_blank"> (Exploring the Mouse Visual Cortex) </a> had been
 accepted as a <a href = "https://www.world-wide.org/neuromatch-5.0/exploring-mouse-visual-cortex-64b9e2db/nmc-video.mp4" target= "blank">flash talk</a> in <a href= 
 "https://conference.neuromatch.io/"> neuromatch conference 2022</a>. In addition, I also attended <a href ="https://www.gtec.at/spring-school-2022/"
 target="_blank">BCI & Neurotechnology Spring School 2022 </a>, organized by g.tec medical engineering GmbH.
 
 Before attending these summer schools, I worked as a Research Engineer in the AimsLab, at United International University <a href = "https://www.uiu.ac.bd/">(UIU)</a>,
 Dhaka. I predicted consumers' preference, their purchase intention, and attention for specific marketing stimuli through machine learning models using EEG signals and 
 Eye-tracker. My study on neuromarketing led to a conference paper, <a href = "https://anannabiswas.github.io/assets/paper/icca.pdf" target="_blank"> An Overview of
 Neuromarketing Research in Developing Countries </a> which was published in <a href= "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3542954.3542977" target="_blank">
 ACM</a>. Prior to this, I hold a position as a Research Assistant in an AI-based software company, named Brainekt where I conducted research on breast-cancer image 
 classification, ECG signal analysis, and monitoring wheelchair patients using EEG signals and published two conference paper, namely <a href ="/assets/paper/eict.pdf"
 target="_blank">Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Detection by A Gated Recurrent Unit Network with Self Attention</a>, and <a href ="/assets/paper/iccit.pdf"
 target="_blank">Classification of ECG signals by dot Residual LSTM Network with Data Augmentation for Anomaly Detection</a>.
