 Hello, I am Ananna, received a B.Sc. degree in ECE (Electronics and Communication Engineering) from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET), Khulna,
 Bangladesh in 2019. At present, I am looking for a Ph.D. opportunity in the following research domain: computational neuroscience, signal processing, BCI, machine(deep)
 learning, and computer vision.

 During the summer of 2022, I participated in the NMA Summer School of Computational Neuroscience Course and completed the project named Deepmice (using the Stringer
 dataset). This year, I also attended BCI & Neurotechnology Spring School 2022, organized by g.tec medical engineering GmbH.

 Before attending these summer schools, I worked as a Research Engineer in the AimsLab, at United International University (UIU), Dhaka in 2021. My main goal was to
 predict consumer response (preference, purchase intention, & attention) to the marketing stimuli through machine learning models using EEG signals and Eye-tracker. 
 Before working on this neuromarketing project, I hold a position as a Research Assistant in an AI-based software company, named Brainekt and conducted research on
 breast-cancer image classification,  ECG signal analysis, and monitoring wheelchair patients using EEG signals. Moreover, during my undergraduate period, I was a Fablab
 Operator at KUET.
