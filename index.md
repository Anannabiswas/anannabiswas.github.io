 Hello, I am Ananna, received a B.Sc. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET), Khulna,
 Bangladesh in 2019. At present, I am looking for a Ph.D. opportunity in the following research domain: computational neuroscience, signal processing, BCI, machine
 learning, deep learning and computer vision.

 As a part of my skill development, I participated in the <a href = "https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html">NMA Summer School of Computational
 Neuroscience</a> course this year and completed the project <a href = "https://anannabiswas.github.io/projects"> (Activity in mouse visual cortex predicts spontaneous
 running behaviour)</a> successfully. Additionally, our abstract <a href = "https://conference.neuromatch.io/abstract?edition=2022-5&submission_id=recZnWRlYhS39CEJW">
 (Exploring the different functions of excitatory and inhibitory cells in visual cortex of mouse) </a> has been accepted in <a href= "https://conference.neuromatch.io/"> 
 neuromatch conference 2022</a>. In this year, I also attended <a href = "https://www.gtec.at/spring-school-2022/"> BCI & Neurotechnology Spring School 2022 </a>, 
 organized by g.tec medical engineering GmbH.
 
 Before attending these summer schools, I worked as a Research Engineer in the AimsLab, at United International University <a href = "https://www.uiu.ac.bd/">(UIU)</a>,
 Dhaka. I predicted consumers' preference, their purchase intention, and attention for specific marketing stimuli through machine learning models using EEG signals and 
 Eye-tracker. My study on neuromarketing led to an conference paper, <a href = "https://anannabiswas.github.io/assets/paper/icca.pdf"> An Overview of Neuromarketing 
 Research in Developing Countries </a> which was published in <a href= "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3542954.3542977">
 ACM</a>.
 Prior to this, I hold a position as a Research Assistant in an AI-based software company, named Brainekt and conducted research on breast-cancer image classification, 
 ECG signal analysis, and monitoring wheelchair patients using EEG signals.
