 Hello, I am Ananna, received a B.Sc. degree in ECE (Electronics and Communication Engineering) from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET), Khulna,
 Bangladesh in 2019. At present, I am looking for a Ph.D. opportunity in the following research domain: computational neuroscience, signal processing, BCI, machine(deep)
 learning, and computer vision.

 During this summer of 2022, I participated in the NMA Summer School of Computational Neuroscience Course and completed the course project successfully. This year, I
 also attended BCI & Neurotechnology Spring School 2022, organized by g.tec medical engineering GmbH.

 Before attending these summer schools, I worked as a Research Engineer in the AimsLab, at United International University (UIU), Dhaka in 2021. My main goal was to
 predict consumer response (preference, purchase intention, & attention) to the marketing stimuli through machine learning models using EEG signals and Eye-tracker. 
 Prior to this, I hold a position as a Research Assistant in an AI-based software company, named Brainekt and conducted research on breast-cancer image classification, 
 ECG signal analysis, and monitoring wheelchair patients using EEG signals. 
 
 <h5>Research Interest and Hobbies: </h5>
  
 <p> 
 Statistics:Descriptive Analysis, Pearson Correlation <br>
 Machine Learning:Supervised Learning, Semi-supervised Learning, Unsupervised learning, Reinforcement Learning, SVM,CNN, RNN, GRU, LSTM <br>
 Signal Processing: EEG, ECG, PCA, ICA<br>
 Computational Neuroscience: Dynamical Systems, Stochastic Process,Computatinal modelling <br>
 Computer Vision: biomedical image processing <br>
   
 
 Apart from doing and thinking about research, I spend a lot of my free time with my diary, books (mostly non-fiction), my indoor plants and Rubik's cube(classic 3X3).
 I love to draw and listen classical music. I like to learn new instruments. At present, I am learning to play flute. Above all, I am a homesick person though I enjoy
 outing and travelling with my close friends and family members.
