 Apart from doing and thinking about research, I spend my leisure time by writing diaries, reading books (mostly non-fiction), raising indoor plants and solving rubik's cube(classic 3X3).
 I love to draw and listen classical music. I have a habit of continuous learning. In fact, I try to learn different types of musical instruments. At present, I am learning to play the flute.
 Above all, I am a homesick person though I enjoy outing and travelling with my close friends and family members.
